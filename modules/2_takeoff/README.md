# Engineering Computations

The first module of this course, [_"Get data off the ground"_](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp/tree/master/modules/1_offtheground),
assumed no coding experience and created a foundation with Python programming constructs and data structures.
You learned to play with strings, lists and NumPy arrays, using indexing, slicing, for- and if-statements, and functions.
The second course module explores practical statistical analysis with Python.

## Module 2: Take off with stats

### [Lesson 1](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp2lesson1): Cheers! Stats with beers

Exploratory analysis using a data set of canned craft beers in the US. Introduces the `pandas`library and its data types: Data Frames and Series. Use `pandas` to read a data file, extract selected columns, and remove null values. Descriptive statistics: measures of central tendency and variability. Distribution plots: histograms with Matplotlib. Comparing with a normal distribution.
