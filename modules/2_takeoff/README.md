# Engineering Computations

The first module of this course, [_"Get data off the ground"_](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp/tree/master/modules/1_offtheground),
assumed no coding experience and created a foundation with Python programming constructs and data structures.
You learned to play with strings, lists and NumPy arrays, using indexing, slicing, for- and if-statements, and functions.
The second course module explores practical statistical analysis with Python.
