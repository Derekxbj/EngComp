    "# Seeing stats in a new light\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second lesson in \"Take off with stats,\" Module 2 of our course in _Engineering Computations_. In the previous lesson, [Cheers! Stats with Beers](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp2lesson1), we did some exploratory data analysis with a data set of canned craft beers in the US. We'll continue using that same data set here, but with a new focus on _visualizing statistics_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In her lecture [\"Looking at Data\"](https://youtu.be/QYDuAo9r1xE), Prof. Kristin Sainani says that you should always plot your data. Immediatly, several things can come to light: are there outliers in your data? (Outliers are data points that look abnormally far from other values in the sample.) Are there data points that don't make sense? (Errors in data entry can be spotted this way.) And especially, you want to get a _visual_ representation of how data are distributed in your sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll play around with different ways of visualizing data. There are so many ways to play! Have a look at the gallery of [The Data Viz Project](http://datavizproject.com) by ferdio (a data viz agency in Copenhagen). Aren't those gorgeous? Wouldn't you like to be able to make some pretty pics like that? Python can help!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin. We'll import our favorite Python libraries, and set some font parameters for our plots to look nicer. Then we'll load our data set for craft beers and begin!"
