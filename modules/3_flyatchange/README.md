# Engineering Computations


## Module 3: Fly at change in systems

### [Lesson 1](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp3lesson1): Catch things in motion

Working with images and videos in Python using `imageio`. Interactive Matplotlib figures in the notebook, and capturing mouse clicks on images for digitizing an object's position. Computing velocity and acceleration from position captures: a falling ball, and projectile motion. Computing numerical derivatives using differences. Free-fall acceleration from real data.

### [Lesson 2](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp3lesson2): Step to the future

Computing velocity and position from accelerometer data: a roller-coaster ride. Using the `subplot()` function go draw more than one plot in the same figure. **Euler's method** for initial-value problems. The second-order differential model for an object in free fall written as two first-order differential equations, leading to a vector form. General design of a code to solve ODE. Application to free fall of a tennis ball and comparison with experimental data. Improved model accounting for air resistance.
