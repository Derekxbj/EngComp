# Engineering Computations


## Module 3: Fly at change in systems

### [Lesson 1](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp3lesson1): Catch things in motion

Working with images and videos in Python using `imageio`. Interactive Matplotlib figures in the notebook, and capturing mouse clicks on images for digitizing an object's position. Computing velocity and acceleration from position captures: a falling ball, and projectile motion. Computing numerical derivatives using differences. Free-fall acceleration from real data.
