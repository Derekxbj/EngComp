# Engineering Computations

A sophomore course in Engineering Computations at the George Washington University, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department. 
The local course number is [MAE 2117](http://bulletin.gwu.edu/search/?P=MAE%202117). 

This is a full course re-write for Fall 2017, by Prof. Lorena A. Barba and doctoral student Natalia C. Clementi.

The course consists of a set of somewhat self-contained Modules, addressing an area of application or skills in computing.
Each module is made up of four or five lessons, written as a Jupyter notebook.
We use Python as the programming language.

## Course Philosophy
We take inspiration in the ideas of Seymour Papert about computational thinking.
In particular, we want to design a course that adheres to Papert's _Power Principle_:

> What comes first, "using" or "understanding"? The natural mode of learning is to first use, leading slowly to understanding. New ideas are a source of power to _do something_.

## Course Modules

**[Module 1: Get data off the ground](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp/tree/master/modules/1_offtheground)**

1) Interacting with Python
2) Play with data in Jupyter
3) Strings and lists in action (MAE Bulletin example)
4) Play with NumPy arrays
5) Linear regression with real data

**[Module 2: Take off with stats](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp/tree/master/modules/2_takeoff)**

1) Cheers! Stats with beers
2) Seeing stats in a new light
3) Lead in lipstick

**Module 3: Fly at change in systems**

**Module 4: Land on vector spaces**
