# Engineering Computations

A sophomore course in Engineering Computations at the George Washington University, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department. 
The local course number is [MAE 2117](http://bulletin.gwu.edu/search/?P=MAE%202117). 

This is a full course re-write for Fall 2017, by Prof. Lorena A. Barba and doctoral student Natalia C. Clementi.

The course consists of a set of somewhat self-contained Modules, addressing an area of application or skills in computing.
Each module is made up of four or five lessons, written as a Jupyter notebook.
We use Python as the programming language.

## Course Philosophy
We take inspiration in the ideas of Seymour Papert about computational thinking.
In particular, we want to design a course that adheres to Papert's _Power Principle_:

> What comes first, "using" or "understanding"? The natural mode of learning is to first use, leading slowly to understanding. New ideas are a source of power to _do something_.

## Course Modules

**[Module 1: Get data off the ground](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp/tree/master/modules/1_offtheground)**
— Learn to interact with Python and handle data with Python.

1) Interacting with Python
2) Play with data in Jupyter
3) Strings and lists in action (a full example)
4) Play with NumPy arrays
5) Linear regression with real data

**[Module 2: Take off with stats](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp/tree/master/modules/2_takeoff)**
— Hands-on data analysis using a computational approach and real-life applications.

1) Cheers! Stats with beers
2) Seeing stats in a new light
3) Lead in lipstick (a full example)
4) Life expectancy and wealth

**[Module 3: Fly at change in systems](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp/tree/master/modules/3_flyatchange)**
— Tackling the dynamics of change with computational thinking. (Under development.)

1) Catch things in motion

**Module 4: Land on vector spaces**
— Using vectors and matrices in engineering with the power of linear algebra. (Under development.)
