# Engineering Computations

A sophomore course in Engineering Computations at the George Washington University, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department. 
The local course number is [MAE 2117](http://bulletin.gwu.edu/search/?P=MAE%202117). 

This is a full course re-write for Fall 2017, by Prof. Lorena A. Barba and doctoral student Natalia C. Clementi.

The course consists of a set of somewhat self-contained Modules, addressing an area of application or skills in computing.
Each module is made up of four or five lessons, written as a Jupyter notebook.
We use Python as the programming language.

## Course Philosophy
We take inspiration in the ideas of Seymour Papert about computational thinking.
In particular, we want to design a course that adheres to Papert's _Power Principle_:

> What comes first, "using" or "understanding"? The natural mode of learning is to first use, leading slowly to understanding. New ideas are a source of power to _do something_.

## Course Modules

**[Module 1: Get data off the ground](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp/tree/master/modules/1_offtheground)â€”**
Background: What is Python? Idea of interpreted vs. compiled language. Why use Python? It is a general-purpose and high-productivity language.
Getting started: interactive Python (IPython).
Using Python as a calculator.
New concepts: function, string, variables, assignment, type, special variables (`True`, `False`, `None`).
Supported operations, logical operations. Reading error messages.
