# Engineering Computations

A sophomore course in Engineering Computations at the George Washington University, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department. 
The local course number is [MAE 2117](http://bulletin.gwu.edu/search/?P=MAE%202117). 

This is a full course re-write for Fall 2017, by Prof. Lorena A. Barba and doctoral student Natalia C. Clementi.

The course consists of a set of somewhat self-contained Modules, addressing an area of application or skills in computing.
Each module is made up of four or five lessons, written as a Jupyter notebook.
We use Python as the programming language.

## Course Modules

**Module 1: Get data off the ground**

**Module 2: Take of with stats**

[More modules to come.]
